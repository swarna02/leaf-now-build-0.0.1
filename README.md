Ever since industrialization started the care for plants has made it to our least priority list, Even though mankind requires plants to balance the food chain that heâ€™s a part of, but the plant enthusiasts are everywhere, be it big metropolitan cities or rural areas, so we aim to bring in a platform that can connect these plant/nature enthusiasts and help them exchange/sell them plants or donate seeds/plants as part of the green initiative that we started 2 years back.
